Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.
The Helm chart for static-site has been successfully deployed.

Accessing the Application
-------------------------
1. Pod Name:
   The pod created by this chart will be named: {{ .Release.Name }}-static-site-pod
2. Namespace:
   The pod is deployed in the {{ .Release.Namespace }} namespace.
3. Port:
   The application is exposed on port {{ .Values.pod.port }}.

Verifying the Deployment
------------------------
- To verify that the pod is running, use the following command:

  kubectl get pods -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

- You should see a pod with the name {{ .Release.Name }}-static-site-pod in the Running state.

Accessing the Application
------------------------------------
- Since the application is running inside a Kubernetes cluster, you can access it internally using the following command:

  kubectl port-forward -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} pod/{{ .Release.Name }}-static-site-pod {{ .Values.pod.port }}:{{ .Values.pod.port }}

- Then open your browser and go to http://localhost:{{ .Values.pod.port }}.

Uninstalling the Chart
----------------------
- To uninstall/delete the {{ .Release.Name }} deployment, use the following command:

  helm uninstall {{ .Release.Name }} -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

- This will remove all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and delete the release.


Troubleshooting
---------------
- If the pod is not in the Running state, check the pod events:

  kubectl describe pod -n {{ .Release.Namespace }} {{ .Release.Name }}-static-site-pod

- Ensure that the DockerHub credentials are correctly set and that the image is available.
